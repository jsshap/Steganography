FriendlyPupper contains in first LSBs of all colors: 

"If I ever write a final exam for a security class, the answers are going to be:

Ehh, I'm not going to write them down. This information probably wouldn't interest anyone."

In Brothers small, I noticed black pixels at the top of All LSB's amplified, and thought it might be a header. I then checked for a header and the first int was 108, so I thought maybe there is a string of that legnth.
There was: "The next sentence is True.
The previous sentence is false.
The previous two sentences are absolute nonsense."

In DogDog, I noticed that amplifying just the red LSB's left a lot of black at the top left, implying a header in just the reds. I checked for a header, found an int (201), and printed that many chars made by the LSB's of red.
I found: 
"Wisdom borrowed from Uncle Jimmy.
When life gives you lemons:
Throw those lemons on the ground, spit in life's eye, and refuse to leave until you get the damned limes you asked for the in first place."

GadgetRadiator has a header reading top to bottom. That header has the int 25 in it

Blue LSB's of Grooming contain, at the beginning:
"Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day.
Give a fish a man, it'll eat for weeks."
The Green have, in the header, 292 and 300. prob image dimensions??? It is. ImageOutOfGroomingGLSBs.png


All of the unnaturalness in grooming's LSB's comes from the greens... I think there is more than jut the one image

AlbumCover red LSB's from left to right have
"Spellcheck is not enough when ordering from a general-purpose delivery company.
Learned when I had to fix a circuit board with some smoldering iron."
Found by checking red header for integer values and finding 169

Red LSB's in header of Brothers have 1536, 2048. Found because a lot of 0 red bits in the top, so I checked red for a header
